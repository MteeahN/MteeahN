## Hey There 👋
I’m Metehan, a web and game developer focused on building scalable, maintainable
systems and interactive experiences.

I primarily work with ASP.NET Core, MSSQL, and modern JavaScript,
developing dynamic web platforms and structured backend systems.
Alongside web development, I explore game logic, system design, and
interactive mechanics. In my projects, I value not only technical
strength but also clean structure, organization, and thoughtful design.

This profile showcases the projects I build, experiment with, and
continuously improve — each developed with performance, clarity, and
user experience in mind.
